  In 2002 the genome of *S. coelicolor*  A3(2), the model actinomycete
  organism, was sequenced.

  The local GC content was calculated using a sliding window of
  100 KB and a 50 KB step size.

  The mean of the local GC content was found to be 72.1% with a standard
  deviation of 1.1. We therefore conclude that there is little variation
  in the local GC content of *S. coelicolor* A3(2).

## Introduction

*Streptomyces coelicolor* is a bacteria that can produce a range of natural
products of pharmaceutical relevance.

In 2002 the genome of *S. coelicolor*  A3(2), the model actinomycete
organism, was sequenced [@Bentley2002].

In this study we investigate the local GC content of this organism.


## Methodology

The genome of *S. coelicolor*  A3(2) was downloaded from the Sanger Centre
ftp site [@S.coelicolor-genome].

The local GC content was then calculated using a sliding window of 100 KB
and a 50 KB step size.


## Results

The mean of the local GC content is 72.1% with a standard deviation of 1.1.

![**Variation in the local GC content of *S. coelicolor* A3(2).** Using a
window size of 100 KB and a step size of 50 KB the local GC content has a mean
of 72.1% and a standard deviation of 1.1.](local_gc_content.png)


## Conclusion

There is little variation in the local GC content of *S. coelicolor* A3(2).
